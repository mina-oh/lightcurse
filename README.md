# lightcurse
Repository for all Light Curse game level files.

We are using Godot to develop the game level; the .gitignore file is set up for Godot. 

IF YOU ARE A COMPOSER OR ARTIST SUBMITTING IN-PROGRESS FILES: 
Upload in-progresses to the Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wb7bdBN2CnRuoHDSF7ee0HivuOBvNh8j?usp=drive_link

Things might take some getting used to with an engine managing our files. We will figure out how this process works as we go.
